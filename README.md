# projet_evenements
Projet fin d'année sur appli web de gestion d'événements


The purpose of this project is to manage, monitor, and keep track of all the transactions made by the clubs in the university.
It's a back end application, and my first application as a software engineer. The repository was set to public in hope that if anyone with better understanding of app 
creation would contribute and help me better it.

I hope to see some useful pull requests.

It's an open source project, you can freely use it if you want.
